# Hedera Africa Hackathon Demo Script
## Track 2: DLT for Operations - Agriculture Supply Chain

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
"AgriBackup solves EUDR compliance for African agricultural exports using Hedera's DLT. We provide farm-to-port traceability with deforestation verification, enabling smallholder farmers to access EU markets through blockchain-verified compliance certificates."

---

## Demo Flow (5-7 minutes)

### Setup Context (30 seconds)
**Problem:** EU's EUDR regulation (Dec 2024) requires proof that agricultural products are deforestation-free. African farmers lack digital traceability systems, risking market access.

**Solution:** Blockchain-based supply chain tracking with automated compliance verification using Hedera Token Service and Consensus Service.

---

### Act 1: Farmer Registration & Production (90 seconds)

**Show:** Farmer Portal (Frontend)
1. Login as Farmer: `farmer@coffee.ke`
2. Navigate to "My Production Units"
3. Create new production unit:
   - Name: "Nyeri Coffee Farm"
   - GPS: `-0.4197, 36.9526` (Kenya highlands)
   - Size: 2.5 hectares
   - Crop: Coffee Arabica
4. Record harvest event:
   - Quantity: 500 kg
   - Date: Today
   - Quality score: 85/100

**Hedera Action Behind Scenes:**
```
✓ Account created for farmer (if new)
✓ HCS event recorded: "Harvest_500kg_Coffee_Nyeri_Farm"
✓ GPS coordinates stored for deforestation check
```

**Talking Points:**
- "Notice the farmer doesn't need crypto knowledge - automatic Hedera account creation"
- "Every action is recorded on Hedera Consensus Service - immutable audit trail"
- "GPS data will be critical for EUDR compliance verification later"

---

### Act 2: Aggregation & Processing (60 seconds)

**Show:** Aggregator Portal
1. Login as Aggregator: `aggregator@kenya.co.ke`
2. View pending farmer collections
3. Collect from 3 farmers (500kg + 300kg + 450kg = 1,250kg total)
4. Create batch: `BATCH_KE_2025_001`
5. Transfer to Processor

**Show:** Processor Portal
1. Login as Processor: `processor@nairobi.co.ke`
2. Receive batch
3. Process: Washing → Drying → Hulling
4. Output: 1,000kg processed coffee (20% weight loss)
5. Transfer to Exporter

**Hedera Actions:**
```
✓ HCS: Collection events from 3 farms
✓ HCS: Batch creation with traceability links
✓ HCS: Processing stages recorded
✓ Complete chain: 3 Farmers → Aggregator → Processor → Exporter
```

**Talking Points:**
- "Every kg of coffee is traced back to specific GPS coordinates"
- "Hedera Consensus provides sub-second finality at $0.01 per transaction"
- "No central authority can alter this history"

---

### Act 3: EUDR Compliance Verification (120 seconds)

**Show:** Exporter Portal - **THIS IS THE KILLER FEATURE**
1. Login as Exporter: `exporter@mombasa.co.ke`
2. Create shipment:
   - Batch: `BATCH_KE_2025_001`
   - Destination: Hamburg, Germany
   - Quantity: 1,000kg
   - Origin country: Kenya
3. Click **"Verify & Issue EUDR Certificate"**

**System Processing (explain while loading):**
```
EudrVerificationService checks:
✓ GPS Coordinates: All 3 farms have valid locations
✓ Deforestation: Cross-check against Kenya Forest Service alerts
✓ Traceability: Complete chain from 3 identified farmers
✓ Risk Assessment: Kenya = MEDIUM risk (not HIGH like Brazil/Indonesia)
✓ Completeness Score: 95/100 (above 80% threshold)
```

- Search for NFT: `0.0.123456`
- Show metadata: Batch ID, origin, compliance score
- Show current owner: Exporter's Hedera account

**Talking Points:**
- "Hedera Token Service issued NFT as proof of compliance - unforgeable"
- "This certificate is the 'digital passport' for EU customs"
- "Cost: ~$0.05 total for entire verification and NFT issuance"
- "Traditional certification: $500-2000 + weeks of paperwork"

---

### Act 4: Import & Customs Clearance (60 seconds)

**Show:** Importer Portal
1. Login as Importer: `importer@hamburg.de`
2. View incoming shipment
3. Click **"Transfer Certificate to Me"**
   - NFT ownership transfers from Exporter → Importer
   - Transaction recorded on Hedera
4. Click **"Verify Customs Compliance"**

```json
{
  "approved": true,
  "certificateValid": true,
  "complianceStatus": "COMPLIANT",
  "message": "Shipment approved for customs clearance",
  "certificateNftId": "0.0.123456",
  "currentOwner": "0.0.IMPORTER_ACCOUNT"
}
```

**Show Updated Hedera Mirror Node:**

## Q&A Preparation

**"Why not use Hedera Guardian?"**
- Guardian is for carbon credits and environmental methodologies
- Our use case is supply chain traceability with product-specific compliance
- Guardian is heavier framework; we need lightweight, fast operations
- We could integrate with Guardian for carbon credit layer in future

**"Why not use smart contracts for payments?"**
- Current solution focuses on compliance, not payments (different problem)
- HCS + HTS provides sufficient trust without smart contract complexity
- Payment distribution can be Phase 2 feature
- Keeps demo focused on core value proposition

**"How do you prevent fake GPS data?"**
- Phase 1: Trust aggregators (they're regulated entities)
- Phase 2: IoT integration with tamper-proof GPS devices
- Phase 3: Satellite imagery verification (ESA/NASA APIs)
- Farmers have no incentive to fake (they want certification)

**"What about offline farmers?"**
- Aggregator records data on farmer's behalf (common in Africa)
- SMS gateway for feature phone farmers (future)
- Farmer cooperatives provide internet access points
- Data collection at pickup time, not real-time

**"Hedera costs in production?"**
- HCS message: $0.0001 (1,000 messages = $0.10)
- HTS NFT mint: $0.05 per certificate
- Account creation: $0.10 one-time per actor
- Total per shipment: ~$0.15 vs $500 traditional certification

**"Why Kenya/Africa?"**
- 2M+ smallholder coffee farmers in East Africa
- Largest producers: Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania
- EUDR threatens 30% of Africa's agricultural exports
- Existing certification infrastructure is expensive and slow
- Mobile-first population (M-Pesa proves digital readiness)
