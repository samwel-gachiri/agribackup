# üåø AgriBackup: EUDR Compliance on Hedera
## Brief Pitch Deck for Hedera Team

---

## Slide 1: The Hook

### **25 Million Farmers Are About to Lose Access to the EU Market**

**EUDR Deadline: January 1, 2025** (enforced)

- Every agricultural import to EU must prove **deforestation-free** origin
- GPS coordinates + satellite verification + complete supply chain traceability required
- Penalty: **4% of global turnover** + product seizures
- **$1 trillion** in agricultural trade at risk

**The Problem**: Traditional compliance costs **$50K-500K per exporter**. Smallholder farmers can't afford it.

**Our Solution**: AgriBackup on Hedera - **$50-200 per shipment**. Full compliance in hours, not months.

---

## Slide 2: What We Built

### **End-to-End EUDR Compliance Platform on Hedera**

#### **Our Platform:**
1. **Farmers** register production units with GPS coordinates
2. **Documents** uploaded (land certificates, permits) ‚Üí IPFS + HCS integrity hash
3. **AI deforestation analysis** using satellite imagery
4. **Supply chain tracked** on HCS (farmer ‚Üí aggregator ‚Üí processor ‚Üí exporter)
5. **EUDR Certificate NFT** minted on HTS for compliant shipments
6. **EU Customs** verifies certificate on Hedera in real-time

#### **What We've Built:**
‚úÖ Full-stack platform (Vue.js frontend + Kotlin/Spring Boot backend)  
‚úÖ Hedera Consensus Service integration (50+ event types)  
‚úÖ EUDR Certificate NFT on HTS (unique compliance passport per shipment)  
‚úÖ Multi-wallet support (HashPack, Blade, MetaMask)  
‚úÖ IPFS document storage with Hedera integrity proofs  
‚úÖ AI-powered deforestation detection  
‚úÖ Mobile-optimized PWA (works on $50 phones)

## Slide 3: Why We Chose Hedera

### **We Need to Process Millions of Transactions for Smallholder Farmers**

| Requirement | Why Hedera Won |
|------------|----------------|
| **Cost** | $0.0001/transaction vs $5-50 on Ethereum = **50,000x cheaper** |
| **Speed** | 3-5 second finality (real-time supply chain updates) |
| **Scalability** | 10,000 TPS (can onboard every farmer in Africa) |
| **Sustainability** | Carbon-negative (aligns with anti-deforestation mission) |
| **Regulatory Trust** | Governed by Google, IBM, Boeing (regulators trust this) |
| **Native Tokens** | HTS makes NFT creation trivial (no Solidity vulnerabilities) |

**Use Case Fit:**
- A coffee batch has **50+ supply chain events** (farmer registration, transfers, processing, etc.)
- **On Ethereum**: 50 √ó $20 = **$1,000 per batch** ‚ùå
- **On Hedera**: 50 √ó $0.0001 = **$0.005 per batch** ‚úÖ
- Kenyan farmers earn **$2-5/day** - only Hedera makes this economically viable

---

## Slide 4: How We Use Hedera

### **Three-Service Integration**

#### **1. Hedera Consensus Service (HCS)**
- **Every supply chain event** recorded immutably
- Farmer registration, document uploads, batch creation, transfers, deforestation alerts
- **1 million+ events** projected Year 1
- Provides **immutable audit trail** for EU regulators

#### **2. Hedera Token Service (HTS)**
- **EUDR Compliance Certificate NFT** = digital passport for compliant shipments
- Minted when batch passes deforestation verification
- Transferred with ownership (exporter ‚Üí importer)
- **Freeze capability** for regulatory enforcement
- **5,000+ NFTs** projected Year 1

#### **3. Hedera Smart Contract Service (HSCS)**
- Automated risk scoring based on origin data
- Conditional certificate issuance (only compliant batches get NFTs)
- Multi-signature approval for high-risk regions
- Dispute resolution logic

---

## Slide 5: Market Opportunity

### **Massive, Urgent Market**

**Total Addressable Market:**
- EU agricultural imports: **$150B/year** in EUDR commodities (coffee, cocoa, palm oil, soy, beef, wood, rubber)
- Affected farmers: **25 million** globally
- Current compliance costs: **$5B/year**

**Our Target (Year 1-3):**
- **East Africa focus**: Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia (5M coffee farmers)
- **Year 1**: 1,000 farmers, 50 exporters, 5,000 shipments = **$500K revenue**
- **Year 3**: 50,000 farmers, 500 exporters, 100K shipments = **$10M revenue**

**Revenue Model:**
- Platform fee: **$50-200/shipment** (paid by exporters)
- Premium features: Analytics, custom reports, API access
- Future: Carbon credits, sustainability tokens, supply chain financing

## Slide 6: Traction & Roadmap

### **What We've Achieved**

**Technical Milestones:**
- ‚úÖ Platform built and deployed (Testnet)
- ‚úÖ 250+ farmers registered
- ‚úÖ 15 exporters onboarded
- ‚úÖ 1,200+ events recorded on HCS
- ‚úÖ 50+ EUDR Certificate NFTs issued
- ‚úÖ Zero fraud detected (100% compliance rate)

**Pilot Partnerships:**
- ü§ù **Kenyan Coffee Cooperative** (500 farmers, Q1 2025 launch)
- ü§ù **Ethiopian Specialty Coffee Exporter** (200 farmers, Q2 2025)
- ü§ù **Kenya Agricultural Research Institute** (satellite data sharing)

### **12-Month Roadmap**

**Q1 2025**: Mainnet launch with 1,000 farmers, first commercial EUDR-certified shipment  
**Q2 2025**: Expand to 5,000 farmers, add cocoa/palm oil commodities  
**Q3 2025**: West Africa expansion (Ghana, Ivory Coast), 100+ exporters  
**Q4 2025**: Latin America launch (Brazil, Colombia), $1M revenue milestone

## Slide 7: The Ask - Partnership with Hedera

### **We're Ready to Scale - We Need Hedera's Support**

#### **1. Grant Funding: $50,000 in HBAR**

**What It Funds:**
- **Account creation**: 1,000 farmers √ó 10 HBAR = 10,000 HBAR
- **HCS transactions**: 1M events √ó $0.0001 = ~100,000 HBAR equivalent
- **NFT minting**: 5,000 certificates = 5,000 HBAR
- **Buffer**: 5,000 HBAR for unexpected costs

**Why It Matters:**
- Subsidizes **real-world adoption** in emerging markets (farmers can't fund accounts themselves)
- Demonstrates Hedera's **social impact** (helping African smallholders)
- Drives **massive transaction volume** (1M+ HCS messages Year 1)

#### **2. Technical Support**

- Engineering review of our Hedera integration architecture
- Mainnet migration guidance (from Testnet)
- Early access to new Hedera features (HCS/HTS improvements)
- Troubleshooting support during high-volume periods

#### **3. Ecosystem Amplification**
