# EUDR Compliance Certificate Integration - COMPLETE ✅

## Implementation Summary

The full integration of the EUDR Compliance Certificate NFT system has been **successfully completed**. All components are now in place for end-to-end certificate lifecycle management.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates ✅

**File Created**: `add-certificate-fields-to-import-shipments-changelog.yml`

Added 4 new columns to `import_shipments` table:
- `compliance_certificate_nft_id` - Token ID of the certificate NFT
- `compliance_certificate_serial_number` - Serial number of the NFT
- `compliance_certificate_transaction_id` - Hedera transaction ID when issued
- `current_owner_account_id` - Current Hedera account holding the certificate

**Entity Updated**: `ImportShipment.kt`
- Added corresponding nullable fields to track certificate lifecycle

---

### 2. EUDR Verification Service ✅

**File Created**: `EudrVerificationService.kt`

Comprehensive compliance verification including:

#### Verification Checks:
1. **GPS Coordinates** - Verifies all production units have GPS data
2. **Deforestation-Free Status** - Checks against deforestation alerts
3. **Supply Chain Traceability** - Validates farmer → aggregator → processor → exporter chain
4. **Risk Assessment** - Categorizes countries as LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH risk
5. **Completeness Score** - Calculates 0-100% compliance score

#### Risk Level Classification:
- **HIGH**: Brazil, Indonesia, DRC, etc. (tropical deforestation hotspots)
- **MEDIUM**: Kenya, Uganda, Vietnam, etc. (moderate risk regions)
- **LOW**: EU member states and low-risk countries

#### Output:
```kotlin
EudrComplianceResult(
    isCompliant: Boolean,
    originCountry: String,
    riskLevel: RiskLevel,
    farmerCount: Int,
    productionUnitCount: Int,
    gpsCount: Int,
    gpsVerificationPassed: Boolean,
    deforestationStatus: String,
    traceabilityComplete: Boolean,
    traceabilityHash: String,
    completenessScore: Double,
    failureReasons: List<String>,
    complianceData: Map<String, String>
)
```

---

### 3. Certificate Lifecycle Methods ✅

**File Updated**: `ImporterService.kt`

Added 3 critical methods:

#### A. `verifyAndIssueComplianceCertificate(shipmentId: String)`

**Purpose**: Verify shipment compliance and issue NFT certificate

**Process**:
1. Run comprehensive EUDR verification
2. If compliant:
   - Get exporter's Hedera credentials
   - Issue EUDR Certificate NFT to exporter
   - Update shipment with certificate details
   - Set status to `COMPLIANT`
3. If non-compliant:
   - Set status to `NON_COMPLIANT`
   - Log failure reasons

**Returns**: `ImportShipmentResponseDto` with certificate info

---

#### B. `transferComplianceCertificateToImporter(shipmentId: String, importerId: String)`

**Purpose**: Transfer certificate NFT when ownership changes

**Process**:
1. Validate shipment has certificate
2. Get importer's Hedera credentials
3. Get current owner (exporter) credentials
4. Transfer NFT on Hedera blockchain
5. Update shipment:
   - `currentOwnerAccountId` → importer's account
   - `status` → `CUSTOMS_CLEARANCE`
   - `importer` → linked importer entity
6. Record transfer on HCS

**Returns**: `ImportShipmentResponseDto` with updated ownership

---

#### C. `verifyCustomsCompliance(shipmentId: String)`

**Purpose**: Verify certificate authenticity for customs clearance

**Process**:
1. Check shipment has certificate
2. Query blockchain for certificate in importer's account
3. Validate:
   - Certificate exists
   - Not frozen/revoked
   - Correct owner
4. If valid:
   - Approve shipment
   - Set `customsClearanceDate`
   - Grant customs clearance

**Returns**: `CustomsVerificationResponseDto`

```kotlin
CustomsVerificationResponseDto(
    shipmentId: String,
    approved: Boolean,
    certificateValid: Boolean,
    complianceStatus: String,
    message: String,
    certificateNftId: String?,
    certificateSerialNumber: Long?,
    currentOwner: String?,
    verifiedAt: LocalDateTime
)
```

---

### 4. REST API Endpoints ✅

**File Updated**: `ImporterController.kt`

Added 3 new endpoints:

#### Endpoint 1: Verify and Certify
```
POST /api/v1/importers/shipments/{shipmentId}/verify-and-certify
```

**Authorization**: `ADMIN` or `EXPORTER`

**Description**: Runs EUDR verification and issues certificate NFT if compliant

**Response**: `ImportShipmentResponseDto` with certificate details

**Use Case**: Exporter requests compliance verification before shipping

---

#### Endpoint 2: Transfer Certificate
```
POST /api/v1/importers/shipments/{shipmentId}/transfer-certificate?importerId={id}
```

**Authorization**: `IMPORTER` or `ADMIN`

**Description**: Transfers certificate NFT from exporter to importer

**Response**: `ImportShipmentResponseDto` with updated ownership

**Use Case**: Importer accepts shipment and receives certificate

---

#### Endpoint 3: Verify Customs
```
GET /api/v1/importers/shipments/{shipmentId}/verify-customs
```

**Authorization**: `ADMIN`, `IMPORTER`, or `CUSTOMS`

**Description**: Verifies certificate authenticity for customs clearance

**Response**: `CustomsVerificationResponseDto` with approval status

**Use Case**: Customs officer verifies certificate before granting clearance

---

## Complete Integration Flow

### Phase 1: Data Collection
```
Farmer → Aggregator → Processor → Exporter
(All supply chain events recorded on Hedera Consensus Service)
```

### Phase 2: Compliance Verification & Certificate Issuance
```
POST /api/v1/importers/shipments/{id}/verify-and-certify

1. EudrVerificationService.verifyShipmentCompliance()
   ├─ Check GPS coordinates (all production units)
   ├─ Verify deforestation-free status
   ├─ Validate supply chain traceability
   ├─ Assess risk level (origin country)
   └─ Calculate completeness score

2. If compliant (score ≥ 80%):
   ├─ HederaTokenService.issueComplianceCertificateNft()
   │  ├─ Mint 1 unique NFT
   │  ├─ Transfer to exporter's account
   │  └─ Record on HCS
   └─ Update shipment:
      ├─ complianceCertificateNftId
      ├─ complianceCertificateSerialNumber = 1
      ├─ complianceCertificateTransactionId
      ├─ currentOwnerAccountId = exporter
      └─ eudrComplianceStatus = COMPLIANT

3. If non-compliant:
   └─ Set eudrComplianceStatus = NON_COMPLIANT
      └─ Log failure reasons
```

### Phase 3: Shipment Export
```
Exporter ships product with certificate NFT in their account
Certificate = digital passport for customs
```

### Phase 4: Certificate Transfer
```
POST /api/v1/importers/shipments/{id}/transfer-certificate?importerId={id}

1. Validate certificate exists
2. Get importer's Hedera credentials
3. HederaTokenService.transferComplianceCertificateNft()
   ├─ Transfer NFT from exporter to importer
   └─ Record on HCS
4. Update shipment:
   ├─ currentOwnerAccountId = importer
   ├─ status = CUSTOMS_CLEARANCE
   └─ importer = linked entity
```

### Phase 5: Customs Clearance
```
GET /api/v1/importers/shipments/{id}/verify-customs

1. Check certificate exists
2. Query blockchain:
   └─ HederaTokenService.hasValidComplianceCertificate()
3. If valid:
   ├─ Approve shipment
   ├─ Set customsClearanceDate
   └─ Return approval response
4. If invalid:
   └─ Deny clearance with reason
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Compliant Shipment
```
1. Create shipment with complete data
2. POST /verify-and-certify
   ✅ GPS coordinates: 67/67
   ✅ Deforestation: VERIFIED_FREE
   ✅ Traceability: Complete
   ✅ Risk: LOW (Kenya)
   ✅ Score: 100%
   → Certificate issued to exporter
3. POST /transfer-certificate?importerId=xxx
   → Certificate transferred to importer
4. GET /verify-customs
   → approved: true
   → Certificate valid
   → Clearance granted
```

### Scenario 2: Non-Compliant Shipment
```
1. Create shipment with missing GPS data
2. POST /verify-and-certify
   ❌ GPS coordinates: 45/67
   ❌ Score: 68% (< 80% required)
   → Certificate NOT issued
   → Status: NON_COMPLIANT
   → Failure reasons logged
3. GET /verify-customs
   → approved: false
   → No certificate found
   → Clearance denied
```

### Scenario 3: Fraud Detection
```
1. Certificate issued for compliant shipment
2. Investigation discovers false GPS data
3. Admin calls HederaTokenService.freezeComplianceCertificateNft()
   → NFT frozen in account
4. GET /verify-customs
   → approved: false
   → Certificate frozen/revoked
   → Clearance denied
```
