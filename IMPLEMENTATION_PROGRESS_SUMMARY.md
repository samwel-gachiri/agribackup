   - Not just batch tracking - individual farmer contributions tracked through entire supply chain

2. **Hedera HCS for Immutable Audit Trail**
   - Every supply chain event recorded on Hedera Consensus Service
   - SHA-256 hashing of batch data for tamper-proof verification
   - Consensus timestamps provide legal-grade audit trail
   - HashScan verification links in UI

3. **EUDR Compliance Built-In**
   - Addresses real EU regulation (EUDR) affecting African agricultural exports
   - GPS-verified farm origins (production units)
   - Risk assessment and compliance scoring
   - Customs document verification on Hedera

4. **Production-Ready Architecture**
   - Clean architecture: Domain ‚Üí Repository ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Controller
   - Input validation and error handling
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Pagination and query optimization
   - Real Hedera testnet integration (not mocks)

5. **Beautiful, Functional UI**
   - Interactive supply chain timeline
   - Hedera verification badges throughout
   - Dashboard analytics with real metrics
   - Mobile-responsive design
   - Professional color coding (green for verified, status indicators)

6. **Token Incentives (HTS Ready)**
