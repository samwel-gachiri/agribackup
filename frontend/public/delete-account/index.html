    <h1>How to delete your AgriBackup account</h1>
    <p class="lead">This page explains how AgriBackup users can request account deletion and the types of data that will be removed or retained.</p>

    <h2>Steps to request account deletion</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Log in to your AgriBackup account at <a href="/">agribackup.com</a>.</li>
      <li>Go to <strong>Settings &gt; Account</strong> and choose <strong>Delete Account</strong> (if available).</li>
      <li>If you cannot access your account, email us at <a href="mailto:agribackupltd@gmail.com">agribackupltd@gmail.com</a> from the email address associated with your account. Include your full name and user ID if known.</li>
      <li>We will verify your request and process the deletion within 7 business days.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Important:</strong> Once deletion is complete, you will not be able to recover your account or data unless you create a new account.
    </div>

    <h2>What will be deleted</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Your profile information (name, contact details, profile photo).</li>
      <li>Your farm(s) and farm profile data.</li>
      <li>Uploaded produce records and images (subject to backup retention described below).</li>
      <li>Produce yields and related harvest records created by you.</li>
      <li>Any non-financial activity logs tied to your account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What may be retained</h2>
    <p class="muted">For legal and regulatory reasons we may retain some records even after an account is deleted. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Payment and transaction history: retained for up to 24 months to satisfy accounting and tax regulations.</li>
      <li>Records required by law or dispute resolution (may be retained longer as required).</li>
      <li>Aggregated, anonymized analytics data that cannot be used to identify you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Questions or disputes</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about account deletion or you believe deletion was performed in error, contact support at <a href="mailto:agribackupltd@gmail.com">agribackupltd@gmail.com</a>. Provide relevant details so we can investigate.</p>
